          <p class="text-white-50"> Ricardo Mighty owns Mighty Properties and the purpose is buy reasonable houses from reasonable people. </p>
          <p class="text-white-50">  Ricardo has been investing in property since 2018 and is based in London.
            Despite having houses across London, his favourite place to invest is the Yorkshire, especially Doncaster.
            Most investors are worried about investing in this unsure economy and after Brexit many landlords are selling up. 
            However, with interest rates from the bank being so low Ricardo is on a mission to continue buying as many decent properties as he can while helping more and more people sell their property without the hassle of Estate Agents and countless cheeky offers from cut-throat investors. 
        </p>
        <p class="text-white-50"> 
            He says,
            
            "I would rather have my money in properties than in the bank, so am always happy to pay a fair price." 
            <br/>
            When sellers ask if Ricardo can buy their house, he will do one of three things: 
            <br/>
            1) Make an offer to buy it himself (usually for 100% of the market value) 
            <br/>
            2) Find an instant buyer for it. 
            <br/>
            3) Immediately let you know that the house is not suitable. 
            <br/>
            Either way, you have nothing to lose.

            So please fill out the form below and find out whether we can buy your house.

        <p class="text-white-50">
        <b>Are you an Estate Agent?</b>
        <br/>
        No, we are property investors. There will be no fees charged to yourself nor will we put your house 'on the market'. Selling with Instant Properties is quicker and easier as we are buying direct. 
        <br/>
        <b>Will you always buy my house?</b>
        <br/>
        No, we typically buy 50% of houses that are offered to us. However, if your house is unsuitable we will tell you immediately and not waste any time. We will also often try to come up with alternative strategies, such as offering to find a tenant for your house instead.
        <br/>
        <b>What criteria are you looking for?</b>
        <br/>
        Regardless of your house specifics and location, we would love to hear from you. 
        <br/>
        <b>How much will you pay for my house?</b>
        <br/>
        This will of course vary depending on the house. We will do a valuation report based on the size, condition and postcode as well as checking the sold houses in the street. If you fill out the online form we will make you an offer. 
        <br/>
        <b>Why should I trust you?</b>
        <br/>
        We have a large network of seasoned property professionals which we utilise to its full potential, so you dont have to worry about our credibility.
        <br/>
        <b>What is the process and how long will it take?</b>
        <br/>
        1. You fill out our online form which takes just a few minutes we'll email you with an estimate of our offer
        <br/>
        2. If you are interested to accept, we will arrange a viewing on the property which usually takes 15 minutes
        <br/>
        3. We will make a formal offer and if you accept, we will instruct the solicitors to draw the contracts
        
        This whole process usually takes between 2 - 5 working days. Thereafter, it is just a case of the solicitors and possibly surveyors carrying out the legal process.
